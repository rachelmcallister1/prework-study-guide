## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to create a study guide webpage to refer back to as I complete the Bootcamp!
- Why did you build this project? I built this project because it was an excellent example and application for what I except to learn during the bootcamp.
- This gave me a lot of fundamental understanding of coding and covered the basics. 
- I learned about the command line interface, I learned several git commands, I learned how to operate the VS Code, and I learned the fundamentals of programming langauges. These langiages included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This study guide has a simple interface. To use it, one can review the notes in each section. These notes are only an overview (along with a few notes of code!), so deeper study will be needed as well. Using the Chrome Dev Tools (right click on Mac, push inspect) will show all topics included in the study guide.
